## How to contribute to kora

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Do not open up a GitHub issue if the bug is a security vulnerability
  in kora**, and instead please contact Matrix directly via matrix@msu.edu.

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/matrix-msu/kora/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/matrix-msu/kora/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

* If possible, use the relevant bug report template to create the issue.

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

* If possible, use the relevant pull request template to create the pull request.

#### **Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?**

Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability, functionality, or testability of kora will generally not be accepted.

#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* Use the new feature issue template to recommend new features for kora.

* Do not create a pull request for a new feature until the related issue is triaged.

#### **Do you have questions about the source code, formatting, etc?**

* While we do our best to maintain code standards, we have not forced these standards in all parts of development. Use wise judgement and check out existing files to get an idea of formatting standards (especially for function definition comments!).

* For all other inquiries, please email matrix@msu.edu.

Best!
