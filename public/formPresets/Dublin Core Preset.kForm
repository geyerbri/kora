{"name":"Dublin Core","internal_name":"Dublin_Core_3_5_","description":"This form contains the original set of 15 properties known as the Dublin Core Metadata Element Set (ISO 15836-1:2017). These standardized fields are flexible enough to describe a wide variety of resources from multiple disciplines. While Dublin Core can be used to describe physical items like books and works of art, in Kora the expectation is that these fields will be used to describe digital objects (videos in mp4,  jpeg scans of photographic negatives, pdfs of digitized documents).\r\n\r\nReferences DCES v. 1 in our documentation: https:\/\/www.dublincore.org\/specifications\/dublin-core\/dces\/ which notes use of the original 15 elements.
